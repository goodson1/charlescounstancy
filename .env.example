# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials

# Google Maps API Key
# Get your key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/
# Secure rotation instructions:
#   1. Keep this key secret—never commit it to git
#   2. Use environment variables or a .env file (which should be in .gitignore)
#   3. Rotate keys regularly and revoke compromised ones
#   4. Monitor API usage for unauthorized access
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# If using this in an HTML page, load the key from this env variable
# Example in a script tag:
#   <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}"></script>
# 
# For a static HTML site, consider using a build process (Webpack, Parcel, etc.)
# to inject the key at build time, keeping it out of source control.
